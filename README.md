<h3> Description</h3> <br>

A to-do list is a list of items that need to be completed. The items on the list can range from simple activities like replying to an email, to more complex tasks like creating project briefs. 

In this SwiftUI project i built a to do list app that helps users to list their works to be done and the works that have completed by green check mark.

This project is nice and easy, it gives me chance to get introduced to whole range of new SwiftUI functionality: stacks, buttons, save, delete, observableobject, alerts, asset catalogs, and more.

 this app used a completely standard iOS look and feel, here i made something more customized with SwiftUI so anyone can easily use the app.
